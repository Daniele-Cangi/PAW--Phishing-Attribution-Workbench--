Hello Security Team,

We observed a likely compromised mailbox sending phishing emails:
- Sender: {from_addr} (Domain: {from_domain})
- DKIM: pass (d={dkim_d}); Received path consistent with your MX
- First external hop: {origin_ip} at UTC {origin_time}

Evidence attached. Suggested actions: reset credentials/MFA; review send logs; check transport rules.
