Hello Abuse Team,

Request: Please suspend the malicious infrastructure associated with:
- IP/ASN: {ip} / AS{asn} ({asn_org}, {country})
- Domain: {domain} (Registrar: {registrar}, Created: {created_utc}, NS/MX: {ns_list}/{mx_list})

Evidence (facts-only):
- Received path origin: {origin_ip} → {your_mx} (UTC {origin_time}), HELO/PTR: {helo}/{ptr}, TimeSkew: {skew}s
- Auth alignment: SPF={spf_result}, DKIM={dkim_present}/{dkim_d}, DMARC={dmarc_result}
- Domain signals: NRD={nrd_days}d, LookalikeScore={bk_score}, MixedScript={mixed_flag}

Verification:
- See attached: executive.md, technical.md, headers.json, received_path.json, stix.json, abuse.json
- Integrity: BLAKE3 root and timestamp in package footer.

Purpose: security/takedown only.

Please confirm within 48 hours.
